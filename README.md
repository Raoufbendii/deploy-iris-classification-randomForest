in this repository, you will find the code for deploying a random forest model on the Iris dataset. The first method you'll encounter, that you will find on 'localhostVersion', was implemented using Flask and runs on localhost. All you need to do is clone the branch, run the server (app.py), and then access it directly from index.html.

For the second method, we utilized Streamlit and deployed it on Streamlit Cloud. You can access the deployed application using this link: https://deploy-iris-classification-randomforest-mvr6lapcymxtxdjcgnydn4.streamlit.app/ and the code is in 'streamlitVersion' bransh

To view the model itself, you can visit this Colab link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1H6M6qo2jY04jagi6SllcH4alR_XvzYUk?usp=sharing.
